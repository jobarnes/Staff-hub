<!-- main content -->
<p class="intro">The University of Melbourne Staff Hub is about giving staff what they need to make their working life easier. Only information, resources and services available to staff appear on the Hub.</p>
<p>The Staff Hub has been created using a user-centred design approach. This means it features content, navigation and design that we know works for staff, using data such as <a href="//its.unimelb.edu.au/about/projects/web-enhancement-program/resources">personas</a>, <a href="//its.unimelb.edu.au/about/projects/web-enhancement-program/resources">user goals</a>, user testing, web traffic analysis and site feedback. We continually improve the site as we look at this data over time, and you can be involved – please let us know what you want to see on the Hub or volunteer to be involved in user testing.</p>
<p>The Staff Hub doesn’t control the content on the sites we link to. That’s a job for the content owners, who maintain their own content. (That includes you for the People Search contact details</a> and Find an Expert profiles, so make sure you <a href="//themis.unimelb.edu.au/">keep them up-to-date.)</a></p>
<h2 id="home-news"> Homepage news</h2>
<p>The homepage news area presents new stories which speak to the majority of University staff about issues which affect them directly. Stories change with the news cycle and importance of the issue, so don’t be surprised to see big stories stay for a while or other stories regularly rotate.</p>
<h2 class="popular">Popular resources</h2>
<p>Web traffic analysis tells us where the majority of staff go after the homepage. These links take them directly to their destination and don’t change much over time. (We review these links annually looking at content or apps with high traffic).</p>
<h2 id="service-directory">Service directory</h2>
<p>Each topic in the service directory comes from common user tasks and is ordered on the homepage by looking at how often it’s used or searched for, as well as standard usability principles.</p>
<h2 id="topics"> Topics</h2>
<p>Each topic page displays the most common tasks staff do on a topic, and displays:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A current news item relating to the topic – this is optional and the content owner supplies the words or image</li>
	<li>1-4 ‘hero links’ – these are major destinations with high use, generally whole intranets or major sections of content</li>
	<li>Lists of links - grouped into no more than 3 categories, for direct access to deep content. The categories group links into sensible types, a bit like a second level navigation does.</li>
	<li>'Not what you’re looking for?’ - links to other related and useful content.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>We want to hear from you so use the feedback option as often as you like. Your feedback will be looked at within 2-3 working days and we’ll let you know the status. If you’re making a request for a new link, make sure you include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The topic where it will appear</li>
	<li>The URL</li>
	<li>A short description of the content or app</li>
	<li>A comment on the rationale for including it under the topic (high use, business critical, etc)<br>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="link-style">Link style</h2>
<p>We make link titles specific, not general, and refer to the user task or content type (what does the link help staff do?)</p>
<ul>
	<li>We avoid vague terms such as ‘information’, ‘resources’ and acronyms</li>
	<li>We look at the local information architecture for keywords to describe the link, and include any functionality (ie what staff can actually do online)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="news-events">News and events</h2>
<ul>
	<li>To come from Communications</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-made">How are changes made to the Staff Hub?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>A change request comes through the site feedback to the website maintainer.</li>
	<li>If the change is minor (like an image, URL, category title, description, new links) we look at:
		<ul>
			<li>University-wide Google Analytics (Roll-up account), specifically search terms and use of destination site content</li>
			<li>Google Analytics Staff Hub account event tags</li>
			<li>User tasks</li>
			<li>User personas</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The change is made, and the owner is told.</li>
	<li>If the change is major (such as page layout, new landing pages, and additions to Popular Resources) this is first approved by the Staff Hub Steering Group.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="keeping-current">Keeping it current</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We look for broken links monthly</li>
	<li>The order of links is reviewed monthly using the Google Analytics Roll up account (use of destination sites) and event tagging in the Staff Hub account (use of specific links).</li>
</ul>
<p>Links may be replaced, re-ordered or deleted depending on what we find.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i">How do I?</h2>
<p>Common tasks are added or edited as follows: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Enter the title of the task using concise, active language, without the ‘how do I’ prefix and without adding -ing to verbs, eg ‘book a meeting room’ not ‘how to book a meeting room’ or ‘booking a meeting room’</li>
	<li>Ensure that the link shows the correct URL for the task.</li>
	<li>Keywords - Enter other words that staff may search on to find this task. You don’t need to use words that already appear in the title or body copy. Synonyms and acronyms work well. It’s ok to leave keywords blank.</li>
	<li>Tags - If this task can be grouped with other content from across the intranet then provide a tag. For example, the tag “meetings” might cover booking a meeting room, organising catering for a meeting and collecting visitors. The tag “rooms” might cover the post room, changing rooms, book a meeting room, prayer room etc. Unlike keywords, you should think of other content across the intranet that you can group using a tag.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="more-info"> More about our user-centred design approach</h2>
<p>Our starting point was research to understand the user needs of the Staff Hub, and the most important information it should contain. We drew on feedback from a series of interviews and workshops with over 70 academic and professional staff across the University, and combined it with an analysis of web traffic to find out the most accessed and searched for staff pages.</p>
<p>We used a combination of user-centred design techniques such as card sorts and surveys, to determine the right navigation labels. In one exercise, 60 staff members were shown a selection of typical tasks, such as ‘view my payslip’, ‘find out about a training course I can do’, or ‘find out about upcoming University events’, and asked to choose where they would expect to find the information. The results showed which navigation labels would help staff find the information they need to complete tasks successfully</p>
<p>We also ran facilitated user testing sessions in a usability lab, where individual staff members were shown an early working version of the Hub, asked to complete a similar range of typical tasks and observed how easily they were able to use it. We were able to refine the design, content and navigation based on the results of these tests.</p>
<p>We will continue to research, test and listen to feedback as the Hub develops, to ensure it stays relevant and continues to help staff make their working life easier.</p>
