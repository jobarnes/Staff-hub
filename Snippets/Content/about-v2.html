<p class="intro">The University of Melbourne Staff Hub is designed to give staff what they need to make their working life easier. Only information, resources and services aimed at staff appear on the Hub.</p>
<p>The Staff Hub is a collaboration between content owners from across the University, with oversight from a Project Steering Group involving a number of areas.</p> 
<p>(You can contact us using the Feedback button to find out more.)</p>
<h2 id="topics"> The design process</h2><p> The Staff Hub has been created using a user-centred design approach. This means it features content, navigation and design we understand users want, using data such as personas, user goals, user testing, web traffic analysis and site feedback. We continually improve the site as we look at this data over time, and you can be involved – please let us know what you want to see on the Hub or volunteer to be involved in user testing.</p>
<p>We started with the concept of common tasks (rather than organisational structure) and asked over 70 academic and professional staff to tell us how they would group the information. We also looked at web traffic behavior for a view of what most staff find valuable and access regularly, and grouped links on the various pages accordingly.</p>
<p>From there, we tested the structure with a range of staff to see how easy it was to use. We then refined the design, content and navigation based on the results of these tests.</p>
<h2>Homepage news</h2>
<p>The homepage news area presents new stories which speak to the majority of University staff about issues which affect them directly. Stories change with the news cycle and importance of the issue, so don’t be surprised to see big stories stay for a while or other stories regularly rotate.</p>
<h2>Homepage popular resources</h2>
Web traffic analysis tells us where the majority of staff go after the homepage. These links take them directly to their destination and don’t change much over time. (We review these links annually looking at systems with high traffic).
<h2>Service directory</h2>
Each topic in the service directory comes from common user tasks and is ordered on the homepage by looking at how often it’s used or searched for, as well as standard usability principles.
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>Each topic page displays the most common goals staff members have, and include news, popular resources and links to deep content, as well as other useful and related links.</p>
<h2>News and events</h2>
<p>This page allows staff to learn more about staff and student achievements and activities as well as practical information about upcoming events and announcements concerning staff. The news page is used for timely announcements about University wide initiatives or University wide events - please contact <a href="mailto:digital-comms@lists.unimelb.edu.au">digital-comms@lists.unimelb.edu.au</a> to submit a story.</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>The Staff Hub doesn’t control the content on the sites it links to. That’s the responsibility of the content owners, who maintain their own content. (That includes you for the People Search contact details and Find an Expert profiles, so make sure you keep them up-to-date.)</p>
<p>If you have ideas on popular tasks, news stories, new links or changes to links, please let the team know using the Feedback button.</p>
<p>We will continue to research, test and listen to feedback as the Hub develops, to ensure it stays relevant and continues to help staff make their working life easier.</p>
